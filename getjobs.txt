Is Your Future Worth Just ₹2.52 LPA? A Critical Look at Fresh Graduate Salaries

Recently, Cognizant announced their off-campus hiring drive for the 2024 graduating batch, offering a package of 2.52 lakh per annum (roughly 20k per month) for the role of IT Programmer Trainee.

Here's what you need to know:

1. Low Compensation: A starting salary of 2.52 LPA is hardly sufficient to cover living expenses in metro cities in 2024. With rising costs of living, including rent, transportation, and daily expenses, this salary often falls short of providing a comfortable standard of living.

let's take a closer look at whether this offer meets the real-world needs of fresh graduates.

Breakdown:

📍Location: Pune, Bangalore, NCR

💸Salary: 20k/month

🧾Basic Expenses:

    •   Rent: 10k
- Food: 12k
    •  Transportation: ₹3k-5k

Total Basic Living Costs:
22k-25k

This means that the offered salary barely covers basic living expenses, leaving little room for savings or unforeseen costs. For skilled professionals who have invested years in education and skill development, this compensation is not only insufficient but also reflects poorly on the industry's commitment to fair wages.

2. Work-Life Balance Concerns: Freshers are expected to adapt quickly to business projects and perform various tasks such as database management, coding, and manual/automated testing. The high expectations and intense work environment can often lead to a poor work-life balance.

3. Unrealistic Expectations: The starting salary and demanding work expectations reflect a troubling trend where companies are not keeping pace with inflation and rising living costs. For many, this doesn't align with the investments made in their education and skill development.

4. Lack of Transparency: Companies like Cognizant & Wipro should be more transparent about their expectations and compensation structures. Fresh graduates deserve to be fully informed about what their roles entail and the realistic career progression they can expect.

What Can Students Do?

1. Research and Evaluate: Thoroughly investigate the company, its compensation packages, and job expectations. Don't just settle for the first offer-evaluate how it aligns with your career goals and financial needs.
2. Negotiate: Don't shy away from negotiating your salary and job terms. If you believe your skills and potential warrant a better package, communicate this to your prospective employer.

3. Consider Your Worth: Your skills and qualifications are valuable. Explore various opportunities and industries to find roles that offer better compensation and growth prospects.

4. Advocate for Fairness: Collective action can drive change and improve conditions for everyone.

It's time to rethink the value of our skills and the compensation we deserve. As engineering students and fresh graduates, let's not settle for less. Your talent and hard work should be recognized and rewarded fairly.

When asked about frequent job changes?

It's essential to respond with honesty and clarity while highlighting the positive aspects of your career journey.

Here’s how you can address this: 👇

In my earlier roles, I was exploring different industries and positions to discover where my passions truly lie. 

While some positions weren’t the perfect match, each experience taught me valuable skills and insights.

I believe in continually challenging myself and seeking opportunities that align with my long-term career goals. 

As I've progressed, I've gained a clearer understanding of what I'm looking for in a role and a company culture. 

Ultimately, my frequent job changes have shaped me into a versatile and adaptable professional, ready to tackle new challenges head-on.

I'm committed to finding stability and growth in my next role, and I see this opportunity as a perfect fit for both my skills and aspirations.

What makes Germany 🇩🇪 a good place to live and work as a software engineer?

Here's a quick rundown of the key reasons:

1. Healthy work-life balance

According to the OECD, Germany is ranked among the top 10 countries for work-life balance. To put that in perspective, most full-time employees work under 40 hours per week. You’ll also enjoy 10+ paid holidays and at least four weeks of paid time off. And if you land a job with a thrifty tech company, you might even get upwards of five weeks’ holiday – it’s increasingly common.

2. Social security

Germany has a great social security system which covers a multitude of needs. Of course, you take a significant pay cut to enjoy these benefits, but most people find it worthwhile. As an expat on a work visa, you’ll have access to free medical care, unemployment benefits (after 12 months of paying tax), and dental care. You’ll also be paying for your pension, so if you plan to retire in Germany, that’ll be something you can access at the end of your career.

3. Fair salaries

Germany ranks in the top 10 for developer salaries. Entry-level salaries aren’t anything to get excited about, you’re usually looking at around €30,000-€40,000. If it’s a unicorn company or something like IBM or SAP, the salary can be €40k+. Senior engineers might be looking at a minimum of around €60,000. If you’re good, though, maybe you take equity in a company or a top position in a unicorn, you can make €100,000-€200,000 in a year. This is considered an exceptional salary for Europe. 

The higher paying tech roles are typically in Berlin or Munich. Average salaries are higher in Munich, but Berlin has a bigger expat community, has more job opportunities, and offers a lower cost of living. If you are coming from the US, UK or even Australia, you’ll appreciate the lower cost of living.

4. Travel opportunities

Situated at the heart of Europe, Germany serves as an ideal springboard for exploring the continent. With its central location, travelling within Europe is not only easy but also affordable. For instance, a one-way flight ticket from Berlin to London can cost as little as €30.

5. Tech scene/career opportunities

Germany has one of the largest and most vibrant startup ecosystems in the world. There are more than 60,000 startups across the country! In Berlin, for example, you’ve got over 20 tech unicorns (HelloFresh, Personio, N26, Choco, Contentful, to name a few) that offer great pay and opportunities to work with some of the most skilled workers in the scene.

Germany is also home to the offices of numerous tech giants, including FAANG (MAANG).

How to decide whether to relocate for a job?

Here are some tips from our team:

1. Consider Lifestyle Compatibility:

- Assess how the new location aligns with your lifestyle, including considerations for your partner/family.

- Evaluate whether the cultural and social aspects of the new place resonate with your identity and personal satisfaction.

2. Evaluate Employer Support:

Research the level of support offered by your future employer, such as relocation assistance and career growth opportunities.

Though money shouldn't control your decision, it's a good idea to move for a company that shows their appreciation for your move through help (both physically and financially).

3. Reflect on Personal Development:

- Think beyond work hours and consider how the move will impact your overall quality of life, including commute, proximity to loved ones, and climate.

- Analyze the financial implications of the move, ensuring that the salary offered justifies the cost of living in the new area.

- Assess the potential for career progression and networking opportunities in the new city, considering both short-term and long-term career goals.

4. Make a Well-Informed Decision:

Take a holistic approach when deciding whether to move for a job, considering factors like career progression, financial impact, family and social life, and overall quality of life.


PS: We have a post on our blog that elaborates on each of the above tips in greater detail. Here's the link for those interested: https://relocate.me/blog/job-relocation/how-to-decide-whether-to-relocate-for-a-job.

​​Let's talk about how you can negotiate a relocation package.

Some companies might initially offer limited support, such as only providing visa assistance. The richness of your package can depend significantly on how much the company needs you and your negotiating skills.

Here are some tips/actionable steps to help you negotiate:

✅ Start by exploring the typical components included in relocation packages within your industry.

✅ Familiarize youself with the factors that influence the content and value of relocation packages:

- Size, age, and financial performance of the company: Larger/more established companies typically provide a broader range of relocation perks than young startups. 

- Role within the company: Higher-ranking employees often have access to more comprehensive packages, reflecting the importance of their position.

- New hire vs. current employee: Companies might offer more enticing packages to lure new talent or ensure a smooth transition for existing employees taking on new roles in different locations.

Understanding these variables can help you set realistic expectations.

✅ Assess your needs.

- Make a list of all the costs associated with your relocation. This should include visa processing, flights, first the month's rent & deposit, moving your belongings, and any initial settling-in necessities.

- Arrange these needs in order of importance. Critical elements like housing, flights and moving costs should be at the top of your list.

✅ Calculate the estimated costs of relocating from your home country to the target location to comprehensively understand your budget needs. The example provided in this article will guide you.

✅ Use the research and cost estimates you've gathered to back up your requests. Explain how each component of the relocation package is crucial for your smooth transition. 

You might say, "Based on my research, shipping my belonings from the US to the UK is approximately $1,500. Covering this expense would significantly ease my move and allow me to focus fully on my new role from day one."

✅ Acknowledge that it might not be possible to cover all costs — especially when it comes to smaller companies — and suggest alternatives. For example:

"I understand budget constraints may not allow for full coverage of these costs. Would it be possible to consider a lump-sum payment or partial reimbursements? This could give me the flexibility to allocate funds where they're most needed."

✅ Get the agreed-upon relocation package documented to ensure clarity and avoid any future misunderstandings. A simple request like, "Can we put the details of our agreement in writing?" will suffice.

✅ Last but not least, check out this blog post. There, we have detailed the above tips and provided additional examples!

Just been scrolling down Twitter and came across a great thread with straightforward and actionable #resume advice for those applying for tech positions: 

https://twitter.com/KittyGiraudel/status/1080473438505127941

Worth your time reading.

Here are a few excerpts to pique your interest:

❝Keep in mind that your resume is not the package.json of your last project. Don’t list all libraries you have ever used, focus on the ones you are good at and want to keep using.❞

❝If you are going to provide a link to your GitHub profile (which you don’t have to by the way), make sure it displays things you want people to see. Mark old awkward/bad repositories as outdated. Make sure the ones you want to showcase are in good shape. Clean it up.❞

❝Don’t detail 15 years of experience. This is very long and likely to be irrelevant. Similarly, skip your old internships, especially the ones that are not related to the job. Focus on what matters: the latest related experiences you had. Stay on topic.❞

❝Remember that your job as a developer is not just crunching code all day. Don’t overlook experience in other fields that could help making your profile stand out such as community work, design, accessibility, mentoring, tech ops, writing…❞

❝Take the time to join a (personalised) cover letter. It might seem like an unnecessary burden, but it shows that you care (at least a little), took the time to write something, and made your research on the company you’re applying to. It makes a difference.❞

❝...it’s an annoying fact to acknowledge, but people will skim rather quickly through your resume. They won’t carefully read all of it. 

This is why you need to make sure that the relevant information is right there, and that the whole thing is clean and tidy.❞

❝...avoid skill charts (e.g. star rating). Charts are meant to represent quantitative information such as numeric data. You cannot put a number on your skills, which makes these charts rather moot. Just mention your expertise with words.❞

As promised, here’s a post about changes to Germany’s skilled immigration rules 👇

Similar to many other European countries, Germany is grappling with a shortage of skilled workers in IT and other pivotal sectors. To address this issue, the German parliament passed a new law in the summer of 2023, amending the Skilled Immigration Act to facilitate the entry of qualified workers from outside the EU.

The first wave of changes became effective in November 2023, incorporating the following among other things:

✅ Reduced salary thresholds for the EU Blue Card.

Starting the 1st of January 2024, the salary threshold for shortage occupations is €41,042 per year. For regular occupations, it is €45,300 per annum.

✅ Streamlined access for IT specialists without a degree.

IT specialists lacking a university degree now qualify for an EU Blue Card if they can demonstrate a minimum of 3 years of comparable professional experience within the last 7 years.

✅ A broader range of shortage or bottleneck occupations.

✅ Changing employers made easier.

Previously, EU Blue Card holders who wanted to switch employers or positions within the first 2 years of employment had to apply for an amendment of their labor market access. After 2 years, they could work for any employer and in any position.

With the updated regulations, EU Blue Card holders must notify the immigration authorities about a change of employer and/or position only if it occurs within the first 12 months of employment. After 12 months of working under an EU Blue Card (rather than 24 as previously), EU Blue Card holders can change employers and/or positions without notifying immigration authorities.

More changes are scheduled to take effect in March and June 2024, including:

✅ The opportunity for Blue Card holders with German A1 language proficiency to obtain a permanent residence permit after 27 months (rather than 33 as currently).

✅ Introduction of the new “Opportunity Card” (or “Chancenkarte”).

Hello, Community! 👋

We’ve got some important news for you:

Relocate.me has partnered with Wise, which helps send and receive money internationally 🌍 without paying hefty charges.

What’s in it for you?

As a Relocate.me user, you will get the first £1,000 of your first transfer through Wise fee-free!

A few remarks:

✅ This is a one-time use discount that applies to transfers where you are sending money.

✅ The discount will be applied when topping up or shipping from your personal or business Wise account, but not when converting between balances.

(You can read more about the fee-free transfer here.)

Setting up with a Wise account is free, and you can send and receive money in 40 currencies, plus spend it in 150 countries – at the cost and speed of local payments. And you can do it all from the Wise app. Handy.

To open a Wise account and reserve your first transfer discount, go to:

​​How can you improve your developer #resume quickly?

Strengthen experience descriptions!

Beyond listing technical competencies and job history, it is increasingly vital to emphasize the impact you have made in your role.

Emphasizing impact communicates your ability to think beyond lines of code. Modern software development is not confined to technical prowess alone; it involves collaboration, problem-solving, and a keen understanding of the end-user needs.

✅ Begin by clearly stating the specific achievement or task and provide quantitative data whenever possible to highlight the extent of the impact.

✅ Start all your bullet points with strong action verbs in the past tense. Make sure to vary these verbs so you do not sound repetitive. 

✅ If you haven't already, describe your experiences in bullet-point form.

Take a look at the difference 👇

Do you remember our post about finding unadvertised yet very alive jobs by using Boolean logic on Google?

We have a small addition:

It is also possible to source international job opportunities from Personio and Recruitee applicant tracking systems.

Here's how:

site:recruitee.com (developer OR engineer) AND (relocation support OR relocation assistance OR relocation package OR visa)

Typing the above into the Google search box will give you a shortlist of companies that are using Recruitee as their ATS and, more important, have job listings or Jobs page with keywords "relocation" and/or "visa." 

So, you might find some new potential employers and relevant job openings that offer visa/relocation assistance. As proof, below are some of the relevant results generated:

- https://gerimedica.recruitee.com/

"If you have the same open mindset as we have, no matter where you come from, Gerimedica might be your employer. And if you need relocation for that, we are happy to support you!"

- https://careers.instapro.group/open-positions

"Do you offer a relocation package and visa sponsorship?

Yes and yes."

- Senior Product Engineer (Frontend) @ Browse AI

"Why join Browse AI:

You live where you are comfortable living; We hire remotely and globally.

If you live outside Vancouver or Canada, you can be offered a relocation package after 3-12 months to move to Vancouver."

------

site:jobs.personio.de (developer OR engineer) AND (relocation support OR relocation assistance OR relocation package OR visa) 

This Boolean search string will give you a shortlist of companies that are using Personio as their ATS and have job listings with keywords "relocation" and/or "visa." Here are some of the relevant results generated:

- Staff Backend Engineer @ JUCR in Berlin

"WHY US?

• 28 vacation days 
• Visa/relocation support from all around the world ✈️
• ..."

- Senior Backend Engineer @ Journi in Vienna

"We wouldn’t be able to do what we are doing without our team and that’s why we offer:

Is Your Future Worth Just ₹2.52 LPA? A Critical Look at Fresh Graduate Salaries

Recently, Cognizant announced their off-campus hiring drive for the 2024 graduating batch, offering a package of 2.52 lakh per annum (roughly 20k per month) for the role of IT Programmer Trainee.

Here's what you need to know:

1. Low Compensation: A starting salary of 2.52 LPA is hardly sufficient to cover living expenses in metro cities in 2024. With rising costs of living, including rent, transportation, and daily expenses, this salary often falls short of providing a comfortable standard of living.

let's take a closer look at whether this offer meets the real-world needs of fresh graduates.

Breakdown:

📍Location: Pune, Bangalore, NCR

💸Salary: 20k/month

🧾Basic Expenses:

    •   Rent: 10k
- Food: 12k
    •  Transportation: ₹3k-5k

Total Basic Living Costs:
22k-25k

This means that the offered salary barely covers basic living expenses, leaving little room for savings or unforeseen costs. For skilled professionals who have invested years in education and skill development, this compensation is not only insufficient but also reflects poorly on the industry's commitment to fair wages.

2. Work-Life Balance Concerns: Freshers are expected to adapt quickly to business projects and perform various tasks such as database management, coding, and manual/automated testing. The high expectations and intense work environment can often lead to a poor work-life balance.

3. Unrealistic Expectations: The starting salary and demanding work expectations reflect a troubling trend where companies are not keeping pace with inflation and rising living costs. For many, this doesn't align with the investments made in their education and skill development.

4. Lack of Transparency: Companies like Cognizant & Wipro should be more transparent about their expectations and compensation structures. Fresh graduates deserve to be fully informed about what their roles entail and the realistic career progression they can expect.

What Can Students Do?

1. Research and Evaluate: Thoroughly investigate the company, its compensation packages, and job expectations. Don't just settle for the first offer-evaluate how it aligns with your career goals and financial needs.
2. Negotiate: Don't shy away from negotiating your salary and job terms. If you believe your skills and potential warrant a better package, communicate this to your prospective employer.

3. Consider Your Worth: Your skills and qualifications are valuable. Explore various opportunities and industries to find roles that offer better compensation and growth prospects.

4. Advocate for Fairness: Collective action can drive change and improve conditions for everyone.

It's time to rethink the value of our skills and the compensation we deserve. As engineering students and fresh graduates, let's not settle for less. Your talent and hard work should be recognized and rewarded fairly.

When asked about frequent job changes?

It's essential to respond with honesty and clarity while highlighting the positive aspects of your career journey.

Here’s how you can address this: 👇

In my earlier roles, I was exploring different industries and positions to discover where my passions truly lie. 

While some positions weren’t the perfect match, each experience taught me valuable skills and insights.

I believe in continually challenging myself and seeking opportunities that align with my long-term career goals. 

As I've progressed, I've gained a clearer understanding of what I'm looking for in a role and a company culture. 

Ultimately, my frequent job changes have shaped me into a versatile and adaptable professional, ready to tackle new challenges head-on.

I'm committed to finding stability and growth in my next role, and I see this opportunity as a perfect fit for both my skills and aspirations.

Looking for an intern to work on a vision project at Mercedes Benz R&D India (MBRDI). 

The candidate should be available for 6 months (on site preferred) and should have some prior research experience and knowhow of latest vision trends like NeRF, SAM, CLIP, etc. 

Please DM a detailed paragraph of your research experience along with your CV or drop me an email at : vasudev.singh@mercedes-benz.com

Background: MBRDI are working towards problems in Intelligent Car Interiors. The team is founded on a research mindset and has experience in publishing in some top tier conferences in Computer Vision and Machine learning. We adapt our research into innovative products used for cars.
Never fall for such trap guys, these sort of certificates are of no use. Always look for opportunities where employers value your time, else wait for the right time
Your time and effort have value. Accepting unpaid internships can contribute to a culture that undervalues people.

Some companies try to exploit interns by giving them menial tasks or excessive workloads without providing meaningful learning experiences or professional growth.

NTT DATA is hiring!
Position: Trainee Engineer
Qualifications: Bachelor’s Degree
Salary: 5 LPA (Expected)
Batch: 2020/ 2021/ 2022/ 2023/ 2024
Experience: Fresher

To find a career path you can thrive in long-term, you have to align 3 things...

1. Do something that creates value for businesses

2. Bring or build useful skills where you over-index

3. Find a way to make it fun and interesting 

1+2 can work short-term, but without 3 you'll get bored and there's no way you can put in the effort to become truly great. 

If you're having a hard time finding your niche early on (I did) here are some strategies you can think about:  

1. Assess yourself
-- what do you love doing? (doesn't have to be business related)
-- what are your biggest strengths? 

2. Research what other people do 
-- talk to ChatGPT about your answers to 1 above and ask for career paths
-- reach out to folks for informational interviews to ask about their roles 

3. Try learning a new skill 
-- to test a potential path, pick up a related course or book and learn a little 
-- if it's fun, that's a good sign. If not, maybe reconsider 

4. Network / build your personal brand 
-- this can help increase your opportunities / at bats 
-- the more people who know you and have a positive opinion of you, the more doors open  
-- consider platforms like LinkedIn and find the people in industries you're interested who are active 

5. Pick up a part-time project 
-- sometimes your employer might let you pick up a small project in a related area (my example: was an Analyst, picked up Paid Search management) 
-- other times, you might look for a part-time side project outside your current employer 
-- you could consider a free project for a volunteer org if you're able 

6. Keep your head up and eyes open 
-- sometimes the best opportunity for you is one you hadn't even considered 
-- always be ready, pay attention, and keep talking to people 
-- if a great opportunity presents itself, be ready to jump (it's okay to be a little scared) 

And don't freak out if you aren't having a ton of fun in your early role(s). 

It got more fun when I learned how to lean into areas that I found more interesting. 

So hang in there, build your skills, and keep your eyes open.

Switching careers is hard.
Looking for a new job is hard. 
Being rejected time and time again is hard.
Pivoting into what feels like an entirely different world is hard.

But you know what else is hard?
Hating your job
Feeling as though you are violating your own moral code on a daily basis
Having physical health issues as a result of work-related stress
Not having energy to do things you enjoy outside of work because you have nothing left to give after work

Choose your hard.

🔰According to my observation, there are more number of openings at least nowadays in these domains- 
- SDE (DSA based) 
- Web Developers(frontend & backend both are in high demand) 
- Data Analyst/business analyst/product analyst (all are mostly similar, with skill requirement of Excel, SQL, Python, ML(in some cases) and analytical mindset) 
- UI UX designer
- AI/ML or data science

Other fields like DevOps, App development, Blockchain are also growing but not heavy in demand as of now. 

Why I'm sharing this? 
Junior students in 1/2 year can try to explore the demanded fields to get maximum opportunities in their future years.

What makes Germany 🇩🇪 a good place to live and work as a software engineer?

Here's a quick rundown of the key reasons:

1. Healthy work-life balance

According to the OECD, Germany is ranked among the top 10 countries for work-life balance. To put that in perspective, most full-time employees work under 40 hours per week. You’ll also enjoy 10+ paid holidays and at least four weeks of paid time off. And if you land a job with a thrifty tech company, you might even get upwards of five weeks’ holiday – it’s increasingly common.

2. Social security

Germany has a great social security system which covers a multitude of needs. Of course, you take a significant pay cut to enjoy these benefits, but most people find it worthwhile. As an expat on a work visa, you’ll have access to free medical care, unemployment benefits (after 12 months of paying tax), and dental care. You’ll also be paying for your pension, so if you plan to retire in Germany, that’ll be something you can access at the end of your career.

3. Fair salaries

Germany ranks in the top 10 for developer salaries. Entry-level salaries aren’t anything to get excited about, you’re usually looking at around €30,000-€40,000. If it’s a unicorn company or something like IBM or SAP, the salary can be €40k+. Senior engineers might be looking at a minimum of around €60,000. If you’re good, though, maybe you take equity in a company or a top position in a unicorn, you can make €100,000-€200,000 in a year. This is considered an exceptional salary for Europe. 

The higher paying tech roles are typically in Berlin or Munich. Average salaries are higher in Munich, but Berlin has a bigger expat community, has more job opportunities, and offers a lower cost of living. If you are coming from the US, UK or even Australia, you’ll appreciate the lower cost of living.

4. Travel opportunities

Situated at the heart of Europe, Germany serves as an ideal springboard for exploring the continent. With its central location, travelling within Europe is not only easy but also affordable. For instance, a one-way flight ticket from Berlin to London can cost as little as €30.

5. Tech scene/career opportunities

Germany has one of the largest and most vibrant startup ecosystems in the world. There are more than 60,000 startups across the country! In Berlin, for example, you’ve got over 20 tech unicorns (HelloFresh, Personio, N26, Choco, Contentful, to name a few) that offer great pay and opportunities to work with some of the most skilled workers in the scene.

Germany is also home to the offices of numerous tech giants, including FAANG (MAANG).

How to decide whether to relocate for a job?

Here are some tips from our team:

1. Consider Lifestyle Compatibility:

- Assess how the new location aligns with your lifestyle, including considerations for your partner/family.

- Evaluate whether the cultural and social aspects of the new place resonate with your identity and personal satisfaction.

2. Evaluate Employer Support:

Research the level of support offered by your future employer, such as relocation assistance and career growth opportunities.

Though money shouldn't control your decision, it's a good idea to move for a company that shows their appreciation for your move through help (both physically and financially).

3. Reflect on Personal Development:

​​Let's talk about how you can negotiate a relocation package.

Some companies might initially offer limited support, such as only providing visa assistance. The richness of your package can depend significantly on how much the company needs you and your negotiating skills.

Here are some tips/actionable steps to help you negotiate:

✅ Start by exploring the typical components included in relocation packages within your industry.

✅ Familiarize youself with the factors that influence the content and value of relocation packages:

- Size, age, and financial performance of the company: Larger/more established companies typically provide a broader range of relocation perks than young startups. 

- Role within the company: Higher-ranking employees often have access to more comprehensive packages, reflecting the importance of their position.

- New hire vs. current employee: Companies might offer more enticing packages to lure new talent or ensure a smooth transition for existing employees taking on new roles in different locations.

Understanding these variables can help you set realistic expectations.

✅ Assess your needs.

- Make a list of all the costs associated with your relocation. This should include visa processing, flights, first the month's rent & deposit, moving your belongings, and any initial settling-in necessities.

- Arrange these needs in order of importance. Critical elements like housing, flights and moving costs should be at the top of your list.

✅ Calculate the estimated costs of relocating from your home country to the target location to comprehensively understand your budget needs. The example provided in this article will guide you.

✅ Use the research and cost estimates you've gathered to back up your requests. Explain how each component of the relocation package is crucial for your smooth transition. 

You might say, "Based on my research, shipping my belonings from the US to the UK is approximately $1,500. Covering this expense would significantly ease my move and allow me to focus fully on my new role from day one."

✅ Acknowledge that it might not be possible to cover all costs — especially when it comes to smaller companies — and suggest alternatives. For example:

"I understand budget constraints may not allow for full coverage of these costs. Would it be possible to consider a lump-sum payment or partial reimbursements? This could give me the flexibility to allocate funds where they're most needed."

✅ Get the agreed-upon relocation package documented to ensure clarity and avoid any future misunderstandings. A simple request like, "Can we put the details of our agreement in writing?" will suffice.

✅ Last but not least, check out this blog post. There, we have detailed the above tips and provided additional examples!

Just been scrolling down Twitter and came across a great thread with straightforward and actionable #resume advice for those applying for tech positions: 

https://twitter.com/KittyGiraudel/status/1080473438505127941

Worth your time reading.

Here are a few excerpts to pique your interest:

❝Keep in mind that your resume is not the package.json of your last project. Don’t list all libraries you have ever used, focus on the ones you are good at and want to keep using.❞

❝If you are going to provide a link to your GitHub profile (which you don’t have to by the way), make sure it displays things you want people to see. Mark old awkward/bad repositories as outdated. Make sure the ones you want to showcase are in good shape. Clean it up.❞

❝Don’t detail 15 years of experience. This is very long and likely to be irrelevant. Similarly, skip your old internships, especially the ones that are not related to the job. Focus on what matters: the latest related experiences you had. Stay on topic.❞

❝Remember that your job as a developer is not just crunching code all day. Don’t overlook experience in other fields that could help making your profile stand out such as community work, design, accessibility, mentoring, tech ops, writing…❞

❝Take the time to join a (personalised) cover letter. It might seem like an unnecessary burden, but it shows that you care (at least a little), took the time to write something, and made your research on the company you’re applying to. It makes a difference.❞

❝...it’s an annoying fact to acknowledge, but people will skim rather quickly through your resume. They won’t carefully read all of it. 

This is why you need to make sure that the relevant information is right there, and that the whole thing is clean and tidy.❞

❝...avoid skill charts (e.g. star rating). Charts are meant to represent quantitative information such as numeric data. You cannot put a number on your skills, which makes these charts rather moot. Just mention your expertise with words.❞

As promised, here’s a post about changes to Germany’s skilled immigration rules 👇

Similar to many other European countries, Germany is grappling with a shortage of skilled workers in IT and other pivotal sectors. To address this issue, the German parliament passed a new law in the summer of 2023, amending the Skilled Immigration Act to facilitate the entry of qualified workers from outside the EU.

The first wave of changes became effective in November 2023, incorporating the following among other things:

✅ Reduced salary thresholds for the EU Blue Card.

Starting the 1st of January 2024, the salary threshold for shortage occupations is €41,042 per year. For regular occupations, it is €45,300 per annum.

✅ Streamlined access for IT specialists without a degree.

IT specialists lacking a university degree now qualify for an EU Blue Card if they can demonstrate a minimum of 3 years of comparable professional experience within the last 7 years.

✅ A broader range of shortage or bottleneck occupations.

✅ Changing employers made easier.

Previously, EU Blue Card holders who wanted to switch employers or positions within the first 2 years of employment had to apply for an amendment of their labor market access. After 2 years, they could work for any employer and in any position.

With the updated regulations, EU Blue Card holders must notify the immigration authorities about a change of employer and/or position only if it occurs within the first 12 months of employment. After 12 months of working under an EU Blue Card (rather than 24 as previously), EU Blue Card holders can change employers and/or positions without notifying immigration authorities.

More changes are scheduled to take effect in March and June 2024, including:

✅ The opportunity for Blue Card holders with German A1 language proficiency to obtain a permanent residence permit after 27 months (rather than 33 as currently).

✅ Introduction of the new “Opportunity Card” (or “Chancenkarte”).

Hello, Community! 👋

We’ve got some important news for you:

What’s in it for you?

As a Relocate.me user, you will get the first £1,000 of your first transfer through Wise fee-free!

A few remarks:

(You can read more about the fee-free transfer here.)

Setting up with a Wise account is free, and you can send and receive money in 40 currencies, plus spend it in 150 countries – at the cost and speed of local payments. And you can do it all from the Wise app. Handy.

​​How can you improve your developer #resume quickly?

Strengthen experience descriptions!

Beyond listing technical competencies and job history, it is increasingly vital to emphasize the impact you have made in your role.

Emphasizing impact communicates your ability to think beyond lines of code. Modern software development is not confined to technical prowess alone; it involves collaboration, problem-solving, and a keen understanding of the end-user needs.

✅ Begin by clearly stating the specific achievement or task and provide quantitative data whenever possible to highlight the extent of the impact.

✅ Start all your bullet points with strong action verbs in the past tense. Make sure to vary these verbs so you do not sound repetitive. 

✅ If you haven't already, describe your experiences in bullet-point form.

Take a look at the difference 👇

Do you remember our post about finding unadvertised yet very alive jobs by using Boolean logic on Google?

We have a small addition:

It is also possible to source international job opportunities from Personio and Recruitee applicant tracking systems.

Here's how:

site:recruitee.com (developer OR engineer) AND (relocation support OR relocation assistance OR relocation package OR visa)

Typing the above into the Google search box will give you a shortlist of companies that are using Recruitee as their ATS and, more important, have job listings or Jobs page with keywords "relocation" and/or "visa." 

So, you might find some new potential employers and relevant job openings that offer visa/relocation assistance. As proof, below are some of the relevant results generated:

- https://gerimedica.recruitee.com/

"If you have the same open mindset as we have, no matter where you come from, Gerimedica might be your employer. And if you need relocation for that, we are happy to support you!"

- https://careers.instapro.group/open-positions

"Do you offer a relocation package and visa sponsorship?

Yes and yes."

- Senior Product Engineer (Frontend) @ Browse AI

"Why join Browse AI:

You live where you are comfortable living; We hire remotely and globally.

If you live outside Vancouver or Canada, you can be offered a relocation package after 3-12 months to move to Vancouver."

------

site:jobs.personio.de (developer OR engineer) AND (relocation support OR relocation assistance OR relocation package OR visa) 

This Boolean search string will give you a shortlist of companies that are using Personio as their ATS and have job listings with keywords "relocation" and/or "visa." Here are some of the relevant results generated:

- Staff Backend Engineer @ JUCR in Berlin

"WHY US?

• 28 vacation days

Hello everyone 👋

Yesterday, we made a LinkedIn post to compile a list of companies that are still hiring talent from abroad, despite the current economic uncertainty.

If you're in active search of international job opportunities, make sure to check out the comments: 

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrewstetsenko_lets-make-a-list-of-companies-that-are-still-activity-7085212970221219841-q_jM

We've received a significant response, with numerous companies declaring their interest in hiring foreign talent. Who knows, some of them might have the openings right for you.

Last but not least, please like 👍 the post to increase its visibility. By doing so, we can attract more employers/recruiters/hiring managers to contribute to the list.
​​Let's talk about motivation.

If you speak about relocation or higher pay as your only motivation for getting a job at a company abroad, don't expect this company to want to hire you.

There's nothing wrong with the desire to flee to another country for a better quality of life or a higher level of compensation, but there is one thing:

Companies are looking for motivated and engaged candidates eager to join THEIR teams!

So, when discussing motivation during a job interview, it's better to:

✅ Express enthusiasm for the company's product: Talk about why you love their product, how it resonates with you, and ideally offer some ideas for its enhancement. Show that you have a genuine interest in what the company is creating.

✅ Highlight their modern/interesting tech stack: If the company utilizes a particular technology or tech stack that excites you, mention it and explain why you are passionate about working with those technologies. Showcase your eagerness to grow in that technical environment.

✅ Share how you feel connected to the company's values/mission/product. Explain why their work aligns with your personal goals, values interests.

✅ Emphasize the desire for personal and professional growth: Communicate your eagerness to gain new and interesting experiences, as well as your aspiration to grow professionally within the company. Highlight how the role aligns with your long-term career goals and the skills you wish to develop.

✅ Mention the opportunity to make an impact: Discuss how the product the company is working on aligns with your passion and how it presents an opportunity for you to make a difference or have a positive impact in a specific area. Showcase your enthusiasm for contributing to the company's success. 

The above are just some ideas. Tailor your responses to the specific company you're interviewing with and give at least a few reasons why you want to become part of its team.

Advice on landing a (tech) job abroad these days 👇

The market is turbulent right now, multiple tech companies are slowing down hiring - especially from abroad - and hence there are fewer job opps offering relocation, but they are.

Simply put, many businesses have ceased their partnerships with job boards/hiring platforms and recruitment agencies in an effort to save money, yet they are still hiring.

So:

1️⃣ Dedicate time and effort to create a resume that effectively showcases your skills, professional achievements, and unique value proposition. Receiving interview invitations is substantially more likely when your resume is well-written.

2️⃣ Enhance your ability to perform well during interviews by practicing common interview questions, researching the company and role you're applying for, and developing concise and compelling responses that highlight your qualifications and enthusiasm.

3️⃣ Search for international job vacancies/potential employers on an ongoing, near daily basis, and do not limit your job search to one country!

4️⃣ And most importantly - use all available resources/tools (Relocate.me should be just one of many) and try different job search methods - apply online, write to recruiters, ask your folks for referrals, comment on job postings of your interest on social media, and so on.

How do you know if your target company is open to hiring (tech) talent from abroad?

Here are some tips from our team:

1️⃣ The first (and simplest) thing you can do is to scan its Careers page and vacancies for keywords like "visa" and "relocation." They indicate the employer's willingness to consider international candidates.

2️⃣ Look through the employees listed on the company's LinkedIn page. If you notice foreign hires among them, it's a positive sign. Furthermore, foreigner-friendly companies often highlight having an international team/employees from multiple countries on their websites, social media profiles, and vacancy pages.
 
3️⃣ Pay attention to the language used in job openings. If a position requires knowledge of the local language or is posted exclusively in the local language, it's likely that the company isn't (actively) seeking candidates from abroad. On the other hand, job postings open to international applicants are typically in English, with knowledge of the local language considered a plus rather than a requirement.

4️⃣ Search for relevant public lists. For instance, the official website of the Dutch Immigration and Naturalization Service (IND) provides a list of recognized sponsors of the Highly Skilled Migrant permit in the Netherlands. On the GOV.UK site, you can find a list of UK employers licensed to sponsor a Skilled Worker visa. Conduct a Google search to discover similar resources.

5️⃣ Check out our International Job Search Handbook on GitHub. We maintain a list of companies that hire internationally. By the way, if you haven't already, give the repository a ⭐ star.


Lastly, we'd like to remind you that we have a blog post that covers finding unadvertised yet very alive jobs that offer relocation by using good old Google Google 🔍 and Boolean search operators.

That’s it for today 🙂

Here's a little tip for those of you who are serious about the international job search.

If you're applying for a job with the description written in English, apply with a resume in English.

It seems like such an obvious thing to say, but we have to continually repeat it as we often see our users - international job seekers - uploading resumes in local languages.

What is the likelihood that a hiring manager/recruiter of, for instance, a German company knows Greek, for example? 

That's a rhetorical question.

So, since many of you asked for a how-to post about obtaining a permit to work in the Netherlands, here it is.

If you're a citizen of a country in the European Union, the European Economic Area, or Switzerland, you don't need a work permit to work in the Netherlands. You do require a valid passport or identity card.

If you are a citizen of another nation, you can apply for either the EU Blue Card or a Highly Skilled Migrant Residence Permit. 

In this post, let's focus on the latter option as it is more common and requires less paperwork.

The Dutch Immigration and Naturalization Service (IND) defines a highly skilled migrant as an employee who works for a recognized sponsor in the Netherlands on the basis of a work contract and fulfills specific requirements.

These are what they are:

📌 You satisfy the universally applicable conditions.

📌 You are under contract to work for a company or research facility in the Netherlands that the IND has approved as a sponsor. (You can find a public register of recognized sponsors on the official website.)

📌 You meet the income requirements:

• €3,672 gross per month for highly skilled migrants under the age of 30 when they apply for a residence visa for the first time.

• €5,008 gross per month for highly skilled migrants who are 30 years of age or older when applying for a residence visa for the first time.

These sums are annually index-linked and are thus subject to change!

📌 The agreed-upon compensation is competitive with the going wage. If your rate is in accordance with the market, it indicates that you make the same amount of money as the typical employee in your field.

Note: Turkish nationals and their families may be subject to different regulations.

By the way, by clicking on this link, you may see the criteria relevant to your nationality.

────

Your employer may submit an application on your behalf if you fulfill the prerequisites indicated earlier. Once more, only a sponsor employer who has been approved by the government may submit this application, and they are in charge of handling your application.

Depending on your nationality, you may additionally need a long-stay entry visa (MVV). Both applications can be made on your behalf by your sponsor—the company that will be hiring you.

Your company must pay the application fee of €350,00. Within 90 days, the IND must decide on the application.

────

Your work or contract duration determines the length of time that your residence permit is valid. The longest length of time that the residency permit can be used is 5 years. If your employment is terminated for any reason during your stay, you will have 3 months to locate new employment before your work and residency permits are revoked. 

After having a Highly Skilled Migrant Resident Permit for 5 years, you can apply for a permanent residence permit.

────

Finally, let's talk benefits for qualifying as a highly skilled migrant worker in the Netherlands.

First of all, highly skilled migrant workers are free from the Civic Integration Act, which other immigrants from outside the EU must adhere to. This means they are exempt from the requirement to study Dutch or get familiar with Dutch culture. 

Another advantage for highly qualified migrants is that if their wives relocate with them, their employer's residence permit application will also apply to them, requiring only one application for the two of you.

Ultimately, you can be qualified for the 30% tax ruling.

So, most of you who commented on our recent message about hitting the 15,000 subscribers mark asked for more diverse job posts on our channel. 

Let's speak frankly. Unfortunately, due to the widespread hiring freezes and cost-cutting taking place in tech right now, we have a limited selection of available job listings on our site. Many employers have temporarily suspended paid advertising on external websites, especially job boards.

A brilliant read with lots of very good advice for those (actively) tech job hunting now: 

👉 https://mhlakhani.com/blog/2023/01/tech-job-market

The author of the blog post is a software engineer let go by Meta last year.

Here are some extracts as a teaser:

❝Before starting a job hunt, think about what you want to get out of the process. All desires are valid - it's just that optimizing for "I want to find the best job and I'm willing to wait" is very different from "I need a job ASAP to pay the bills, anything that pays more than $X works". So think about that and be honest with yourself so that you get what you're looking for.❞

❝Like it or not, preparing your resume is an important part of the process. Focus less on what you did.Instead, focus on the impact of your work❞

❝Treating prep seriously, like a job, really helped.❞

❝The interview setup and experience tell you a lot about the company and what they value. Pay attention to the questions they ask and the people you meet.❞

❝There are a lot of good jobs out there, and not enough of "me". It's still a candidate's market for now, so use that to your advantage. Companies are looking to hire, and despite hiring freezes a lot of great companies are still growing.❞

❝Core skills matter a lot - you have to be good at what you do. In the same vein, at the senior levels, it's less about pure technical depth and more about "soft" skills: how you lead a team, how you work with people, etc.❞

A good easy read with lots of useful advice for those wanting to succeed as a software engineer:

👉 https://www.simplethread.com/20-things-ive-learned-in-my-20-years-as-a-software-engineer/

The author of the blog post is a software engineer with 20 years of experience.

Some extracts as a teaser:

❝Great software engineers think deeply about the user experience of their code. They might not think about it in those terms, but whether it is an external API, programmatic API, user interface, protocol, or any other interface; great engineers consider who will be using it, why it will be used, how it will be used, and what is important to those users. Keeping the user’s needs in mind is really the heart of good user experience.❞

❝The best code is no code, or code you don’t have to maintain.❞

❝Old technologies that have stuck around are sharks, not dinosaurs. They solve problems so well that they have survived the rapid changes that occur constantly in the technology world. Don’t bet against these technologies, and replace them only if you have a very good reason.❞

Let's talk job interviews.

Asking questions during an interview not only shows you're prepared and interested but also helps you make an informed decision about whether the company or role is right for you.

Here are some questions you might want to ask when you're being interviewed for a (tech) job abroad:

What is the reason for this job opening: is it a replacement or a new role? What problems are you trying to solve by filling this position?

Can I speak to someone who has the same role?

In your opinion, why do people stay with your company?

I know your company already has international employees. Can you connect me with one of them?

Tech capabilities aside, what soft skills would make someone successful in this role?

What learning and professional development opportunities are available to your employees?

If I am extended a job offer, how soon would you like me to start?

Is Your Future Worth Just ₹2.52 LPA? A Critical Look at Fresh Graduate Salaries

Recently, Cognizant announced their off-campus hiring drive for the 2024 graduating batch, offering a package of 2.52 lakh per annum (roughly 20k per month) for the role of IT Programmer Trainee.

Here's what you need to know:

1. Low Compensation: A starting salary of 2.52 LPA is hardly sufficient to cover living expenses in metro cities in 2024. With rising costs of living, including rent, transportation, and daily expenses, this salary often falls short of providing a comfortable standard of living.

let's take a closer look at whether this offer meets the real-world needs of fresh graduates.

Breakdown:

📍Location: Pune, Bangalore, NCR

💸Salary: 20k/month

🧾Basic Expenses:

    •   Rent: 10k
- Food: 12k
    •  Transportation: ₹3k-5k

Total Basic Living Costs:
22k-25k

This means that the offered salary barely covers basic living expenses, leaving little room for savings or unforeseen costs. For skilled professionals who have invested years in education and skill development, this compensation is not only insufficient but also reflects poorly on the industry's commitment to fair wages.

2. Work-Life Balance Concerns: Freshers are expected to adapt quickly to business projects and perform various tasks such as database management, coding, and manual/automated testing. The high expectations and intense work environment can often lead to a poor work-life balance.

3. Unrealistic Expectations: The starting salary and demanding work expectations reflect a troubling trend where companies are not keeping pace with inflation and rising living costs. For many, this doesn't align with the investments made in their education and skill development.

4. Lack of Transparency: Companies like Cognizant & Wipro should be more transparent about their expectations and compensation structures. Fresh graduates deserve to be fully informed about what their roles entail and the realistic career progression they can expect.

What Can Students Do?

1. Research and Evaluate: Thoroughly investigate the company, its compensation packages, and job expectations. Don't just settle for the first offer-evaluate how it aligns with your career goals and financial needs.
2. Negotiate: Don't shy away from negotiating your salary and job terms. If you believe your skills and potential warrant a better package, communicate this to your prospective employer.

3. Consider Your Worth: Your skills and qualifications are valuable. Explore various opportunities and industries to find roles that offer better compensation and growth prospects.

4. Advocate for Fairness: Collective action can drive change and improve conditions for everyone.

It's time to rethink the value of our skills and the compensation we deserve. As engineering students and fresh graduates, let's not settle for less. Your talent and hard work should be recognized and rewarded fairly.

When asked about frequent job changes?

It's essential to respond with honesty and clarity while highlighting the positive aspects of your career journey.

Here’s how you can address this: 👇

In my earlier roles, I was exploring different industries and positions to discover where my passions truly lie. 

While some positions weren’t the perfect match, each experience taught me valuable skills and insights.

I believe in continually challenging myself and seeking opportunities that align with my long-term career goals. 

As I've progressed, I've gained a clearer understanding of what I'm looking for in a role and a company culture. 

Ultimately, my frequent job changes have shaped me into a versatile and adaptable professional, ready to tackle new challenges head-on.

I'm committed to finding stability and growth in my next role, and I see this opportunity as a perfect fit for both my skills and aspirations.

🔰According to my observation, there are more number of openings at least nowadays in these domains- 
- SDE (DSA based) 
- Web Developers(frontend & backend both are in high demand) 
- Data Analyst/business analyst/product analyst (all are mostly similar, with skill requirement of Excel, SQL, Python, ML(in some cases) and analytical mindset) 
- UI UX designer
- AI/ML or data science

Other fields like DevOps, App development, Blockchain are also growing but not heavy in demand as of now. 

Why I'm sharing this? 
Junior students in 1/2 year can try to explore the demanded fields to get maximum opportunities in their future years.
